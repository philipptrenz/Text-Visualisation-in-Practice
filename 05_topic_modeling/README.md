## Intro

In this weeks blog post we will focus on
[topic modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_model) using the
from the last weeks known data set of Wikipedia articles of members of
the German Bundestag.

It is to be examined whether the Wikipedia articles, although they
report about the persons themselves and not explicitly about their
political topics, provide information on topics, that are, for example,
of political relevance.

## Approach

For generating the topic model, the prepared data of last week as well
as the
[Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_Dirichlet_allocation)
algorithm out of the [gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/) Python library was used.
