In the meantime, Wikipedia has become for many the standard of an encyclopedia. Due to the open principle of the public knowledge collection, the information content of the online encyclopedia is constantly growing. Participating as a co-creator is open to everyone, each participant is both author and editor. [^1] This raises the question of the objectivity and correctness of the encyclopedia.

In addition to each article page the publicly available version history offers interesting information about the revisions of the article and the authors involved. By visualizing the genesis of an article along with metadata such as the modification date, the author of the modification and the number of revisions, it may lead to a better assessment of the objectivity and authenticity of an article.

While the visualization of the revisions of an article[^2] or the recent changes in Wikipedia[^3] has already been scientifically evaluated, this project will focus on visualizing articles that allow the reader to intuitively assess the controversy, authenticity and quality of the article or its sections based on its version history. In this context, the cross-article influence of authors and their possible thematic affiliation may also be of interest.

Challenging here is the creation of an informative and at the same time intuitive presentation of information, which allows everyone to draw meaningful conclusions from the processed visualization of the article. A source of inspiration can be the study of source code review or the visualisation in version control tools.
